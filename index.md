# Manifold Scholarship
Manifold Scholarship is an open-source publishing platform that enables authors and publishers a means to showcase and enhance the electronic content they already produce in their existing workflows: Texts are displayed in a responsive, elegant reader crafted for all modern browsers and devicesâ€”desktop and mobile. Powerful built-in annotation and commenting systems allow readers to annotate, highlight, discuss, cite, and share passages from any Manifold text. Resources that are foundational to a particular discussion but which are often tabled because of physical, technical, logistic, or legal limitations can be layered dynamically and directly onto the digital text. And with Manifold, a new kind of publication is possible, one where authors create projects that grow iteratively and that are published online as they are created and then later in print, when they have codified into a version of record. In short, Manifold transforms scholarly publications into living digital works.

This documentation will serve as a guide to help surface and navigate those concerns with the aim of publishing materials openly, iteratively, and elsewise on Manifold. Brief by design and written for publishers, authors, readers and developers to be of immediate, practical use, these instructions function as a walk-through of the Manifold format.

If you find yourself unclear about the process, what is expected of you, or if you have questions that extend beyond the scope of what is covered herein, please contact your editor or the Manifold team for assistance specific to your situation. For additional information on how to obtain support, please consult the [support](/contents/reference/support.md) documentation page.

## Getting Started
If you are interested in hosting your own instance of Manifold, begin with the [Getting Started](/contents/getting_started/README.md) page below, where you'll find instructions on how to install Manifold. If you would prefer not to manage your own instance of Manifold, [the University of Minnesota Press](https://www.upress.umn.edu/) offers [digital services](http://manifoldapp.org/services) covering project preparation, hosting, customization and support in partnership with [Cast Iron Coding](http://castironcoding.com). The best place to begin is on the getting started page:

* [Getting Started](contents/getting_started/README.md)

Once Manifold has been installed and configured, documentation is broken into parts that correspond to the main user roles:

* [Publisher Documentation](contents/publishers/README.md)
* [Author Documentation](contents/authors/README.md)
* [Reader Documentation](contents/readers/README.md)
* [Developer Documentation](contents/developers/README.md)

## Short History

The [University of Minnesota Press](https://www.upress.umn.edu) in partnership with the [GC Digital Scholarship Lab](https://gcdsl.commons.gc.cuny.edu/) at the [Graduate Center](http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Home) of the [City University of New York](http://cuny.edu) has been awarded [a $732,000 grant](https://mellon.org/grants/grants-database/grants/university-of-minnesota-at-twin-cities/11500644/) from the [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org) to launch [Manifold Scholarship](http://manifold.umn.edu/about/). The development of Manifold is performed by [Cast Iron Coding](http://castironcoding.com), a digital development agency in Portland, Oregon.

## Open Development

Our ultimate goal is to build an open source tool that other university presses will use. To that end, we want to hear from our prospective users throughout the design and development process. To participate in the discussion, join us on our [Building Manifold Development Blog](http://blog.manifoldapp.org).

## Get the Source Code

Manifold's source code is [hosted on Github](https://github.com/manifoldscholar/manifold). Early adopters of Manifold are encouraged to download the source code, experiment, and submit fixes and features in the form of pull requests.
