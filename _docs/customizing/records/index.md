The `Records` menu is composed of five subsections: Makers, Users, Pages, Features, and Export Targets. The Makers and Users functionality is considered in detail in the [Accounts section](/docs/projects/accounts/index.html).

This section will review how the Pages, Features, and Export Targets menus:

- [Pages](/docs/customizing/records/pages.html) allow publishers the means to relate the nature, history, or policies that inform their instance through custom webpages that can be added to the site and included in the main header or footer navigation.
- [Features](/docs/customizing/records/features.html) describe the header section of the Manifold homepage; the menus available in this view are where publishers control the look of header and provide the means to create alternate header templates for different situations.
- [Export Targets](/docs/customizing/records/export.html) provide the means for publishers to create new pathways to export their content for preservation purposes (e.g., institutional repositories or preservation partners like [Portico](https://www.portico.org/) or [CLOCKSS](https://clockss.org/)).
