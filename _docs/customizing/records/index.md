The `Records` menu is composed of four subsections:

- Makers
- Users
- Pages
- Features

The Makers and Users functionality is considered in detail in the [Accounts section](/docs/projects/accounts/index.html).

This section will review how the [Pages](/docs/customizing/records/pages.html) and [Features](/docs/customizing/records/features.html) menus allow you to create custom pages, which you can use to relate the nature, history, or policies that inform your instance, and control the look of the header section on the homepage.

<div style="background: #d4f2ff; margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px;">
Only those with Administrator, Editor, or Marketeer credentials are able to access this menu in the backend. For more on the roles available in Manifold, see the <a href="/docs/projects/accounts/index.html">Accounts section</a>.
