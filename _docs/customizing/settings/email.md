In the `Email` submenu, you can configure how Manifold will send email to users. Manifold supports sending mail via an external SMTP server or via a local Sendmail installation. To test your configuration, press the "Send Test Email" button at the top of screen. Doing so will send a message to the email address on file for you user.

In addition to setting up the email account, Manifold lets you customize your email closing.
