To add a subject, click `Add a Subject` and begin typing. If there are subjects already in the system, Manifold will provide suggestions to you that you can select; otherwise you can simply hit return (or enter) on your keyboard or click `Create New` in the field, and your subject will be created and assigned to the project. You can create and add as many subjects as needed for each project.

Click the `X` on the right side of a Subject entry to remove it from the project. Note that doing so will only remove the subject from the project.
