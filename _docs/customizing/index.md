## [Contents](contents.html)

* [Pages](contents.html#pages). Used for creating content pages (e.g., About, Privacy Policy).
* [Features](contents.html#features). Where the featured content banner at the head of the homepage can be adjusted.

## [Settings](settings.html)

* [General](settings.html#general). For setting up defaults about institutional and instance identity.
* [Theme](settings.html#theme). A space for customizing publisher branding and style.
