In the `EMAIL` tab of the `SETTINGS` menu, you can configure how Manifold will send email to users. Manifold supports sending mail via an external SMTP server or via a local Sendmail installation. To test your configuration, press the "send test email" button. Doing so will send a message to the email address on file for you user.

In addition to setting up the email account, Manifold lets you customize your email closing.
