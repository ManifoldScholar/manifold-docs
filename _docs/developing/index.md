## Open Development

As a reminder-- our ultimate goal is to build an open source tool that other university presses will use. To that end, we want to hear from our prospective users throughout the design and development process. To participate in the discussion, join us on our [Building Manifold Development Blog](http://blog.manifoldapp.org).

## Get the Source Code

Manifold's source code is [hosted on Github](https://github.com/manifoldscholar/manifold). Early adopters of Manifold are encouraged to download the source code, experiment, and submit fixes and features in the form of pull requests.

## Contribute Documentation

If you have revisions or improvements you'd like to contribute to our documentation, please open an issue or submit a pull request at [our documentation repository](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold-docs).
