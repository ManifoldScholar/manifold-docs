Manifold provides news means for publishers to showcase the work of their authors. This section of the documentation provides a pragmatic walkthrough of the [different types of publications](project_types.html) Manifold makes available and suggests how those can be worked into a publisherâ€™s [existing workflow](workflow.html).

In the coming weeks, we will be adding sections to the documentation describing in detail how publishers interface with the backend of the system, where projects and user accounts are created, where text and resources are added, and how system preferences are adjusted.
