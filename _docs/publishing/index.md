Manifold provides news means for publishers to showcase the work of their authors. This section of the documentation provides

- some considerations for [evaluating projects](proposals.html) for the platform,
- a pragmatic walkthrough of the [different types of publications](project_types.html) Manifold makes available, and
- suggestions for how those can be worked into a publisherâ€™s [existing workflow](workflow.html).
