For general upgrade instructions, see the upgrading documentation for your type of installation: [Ubuntu](/docs/installing/ubuntu/upgrading.html) or [CentOS/RHEL](/docs/installing/centos/upgrading.html).

## Upgrading from Versions Previous to 2.1.x

If you are running an instance of Manifold version 2.0.x or earlier, you must first upgrade to version 2.1.x before upgrading to a later version. Attempting to upgrade directly from versions previous to 2.1.x to later versions will fail.

For discussion of this requirement, see this [github issue](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/issues/2151#issuecomment-492287811).
