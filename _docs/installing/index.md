Unless you are reading or adding a text to an existing Manifold instance, you will need to install the software on a server to publish texts.

**The current, stable version of Manifold is v{{site.data.current.version}}**.

Currently, the simplest way to host your own instance of Manifold is to utilize our Debian package installer. 

In the future, we will be offering package installers for Centos/RHEL, Docker images, and a MacOS installer. The Docker images are currently in-progress, and should be made public in April 2018. The MacOS installer is in testing, and will likely also be released in April 2018.
