We are currently in the process of developing Docker images for Manifold. We plan on completing this effort in September, 2018. In the meantime, keep an eye on our progress [on Github](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold-docker).

If you'd like to install Manifold in the meantime, please see our [Ubuntu installation instructions](/docs/installing/ubuntu/index.html).
