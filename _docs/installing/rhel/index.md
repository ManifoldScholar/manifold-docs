We expect to release RHEL/CentOS packages for Manifold in April 2018. These packages will be similar to our [Ubuntu packages](../ubuntu/index.html), and generated using the same Omnibus packaging approach. Please check back in late April for updates.

If you'd like to install Manifold in the meantime, please see our [Ubuntu installation instructions](../ubuntu/index.html).
