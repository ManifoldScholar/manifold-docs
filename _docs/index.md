Manifold Scholarship is an open-source publishing platform that enables authors and publishers a means to showcase and enhance the electronic content they already produce in their existing workflows: texts are displayed in a responsive, elegant reader crafted for all modern browsers and devices—desktop and mobile. Powerful built-in annotation and commenting systems allow readers to annotate, highlight, discuss, cite, and share passages from any Manifold text. Resources that are foundational to a particular discussion but that are often tabled because of physical, technical, logistic, or legal limitations can be layered dynamically and directly onto the digital text. And with Manifold, a new kind of publication is possible, one where authors create projects that grow iteratively and that are published online as they are created and then later in print, when they have been codified as versions of record. In short, Manifold transforms scholarly publications into living digital works.

## Using the Manifold Documentation

This documentation will serve as a guide to different users aiming to publish materials openly, iteratively, and elsewise on Manifold. Brief by design and written for publishers, authors, readers and developers to be of immediate, practical use, these instructions function as a walk-through of the Manifold format.

If you are interested in hosting your own instance of Manifold, begin with the [step-by-step install instructions](/docs/installing/index.html). If you would prefer not to manage your own instance of Manifold, [the University of Minnesota Press](https://www.upress.umn.edu/) offers [digital services](http://manifoldapp.org/services) covering project preparation, hosting, customization and support in partnership with [Cast Iron Coding](http://castironcoding.com). Once Manifold has been installed and configured, documentation is broken into parts that reflect operations of Manifold:

* [Installing Manifold](/docs/installing/index.html)
* [Customizing Manifold](/docs/customizing/index.html)
* [Working with Projects](/docs/projects/index.html)
* [Writing for Manifold](/docs/writing/index.html)
* [Integrating Manifold into Publishing Workflows](/docs/publishing/index.html)
* [Reading Manifold Texts](/docs/reading/index.html)
* [References](/docs/reference/index.html)

## Request a Feature

If there are features you'd like us to consider building into Manifold, we want to know. [Request a feature](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/issues/new?template=features.md) on our GitHub repo and begin that conversation.

## Short History

The [University of Minnesota Press](https://www.upress.umn.edu) in partnership with the [GC Digital Scholarship Lab](https://gcdsl.commons.gc.cuny.edu/) at the [Graduate Center](http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Home) of the [City University of New York](http://cuny.edu) has been awarded [a $732,000 grant](https://mellon.org/grants/grants-database/grants/university-of-minnesota-at-twin-cities/11500644/) from the [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org) to launch [Manifold Scholarship](http://manifold.umn.edu/about/). The development of Manifold is performed by [Cast Iron Coding](http://castironcoding.com), a digital development agency in Portland, Oregon.

## Open Development

Our ultimate goal is to build an open source tool that other university presses will use. To that end, we want to hear from our prospective users throughout the design and development process. To participate in the discussion, join us on our [Building Manifold Development Blog](http://blog.manifoldapp.org).

## Technical Infrastructure

Manifold's technology stack is made up of the following dependencies. To learn more about how these are employed in the architecture of the platform, see “[A Technical Introduction to Manifold](http://blog.manifoldapp.org/2015/12/03/a-technical-introduction-to-manifold/),” authored by the lead developer of Manifold, Zach Davis.
