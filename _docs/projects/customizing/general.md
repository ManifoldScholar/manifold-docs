The General category provides controls for the most top-level elements for how a project is registered and displayed across the system. If you make any adjustments, click `Save Project` at the bottom of the screen to update the project. Changes go live immediately.

## Title

***Title***. Use this field to update the project title, which displays on the project library and landing pages, as well as associated navigation menus. This field cannot be left empty.

***Subtitle***. Use this field to add or update the project subtitle, which displays alongside the primary title. This field is not required.

## Visibility

***Draft Mode***. For use when wanting to load and edit a project before publishing it for general consumption. When toggled on projects are only visible to users with administrative rights. New projects are set to Draft Mode by default.

***Featured***. Featured projects take pride of place on the home page in a section of the library all of their own. Only four projects display in this section at a time. If more than four projects are toggled to be featured, only the four most recent will show. By default, new projects are *not* set to be featured.

## Other

***Publisher***. The publisher name displays at the bottom of the project landing page in the About section, alongside any information input in the [Metadata](metadata.html) section, and is also used to generate citations (see [Reading Interface](/readers/reading-interface.html#share)). The name input here is intended to refer to the project as a whole, not specific texts or resources within it. Note that this field is also repeated in the [Metadata](metadata.html) section: they are linked together, and changes to one will be reflected in the other. This field is surfaced in two places because of its importance.

***Publication Date***. A publication date is required by the system to generate citations (see [Reading Interface](/readers/reading-interface.html#share)). The date here refers to the project as a whole and will be superseded by a publication date associated with specific texts (see [Text Metadata](texts.html#metadata)).

***Hashtag***. This field is a means to suggest a hashtag to those interested in discussing a project in social media. Include the hashmark (#) with the tag, and it will appear in the lower left part of the header on the project's landing page. See the [Social](social.html) section for instruction on how to pull Tweets using the hashtag into the project's [Activity](activity.html) feed.

***Subjects***. Subjects provide a means to categorize projects, which readers can use as filters to sort through the collection of projects on the landing page (see [Projects Library](/readers/projects_library.html#ourprojects)).

To add a subject, click `+ Add a Subject` and begin typing. If there are subjects already in the system, Manifold will provide suggestions to you that you can select; otherwise you can simply hit return (or enter) on your keyboard or click `Create New` in the field, and your subject will be created and assigned to the project. You can create and add as many subjects as needed for each project.

Click the `X` on the right side of a Subject entry to remove it from the project. Note that doing so will only remove the subject from the project. To rename or delete a subject from the system, go to the Subjects sidebar in the [Settings](/settings/subjects.html) section.

***Project Thumbnail***. This table allows you to modify or customize the avatar representing the project, which displays in the library on the landing page. If no custom avatar has been added to the system, the default icon—made up of eye glasses, a dialog bubble, and a pencil—shows in the left panel.

You can adjust the color of the default icon by selecting from one of the six preset options in the middle panel labelled `Default`.

You can also upload (as a JPEG, TIFF, GIF, or PNG) a new avatar using the right panel labeled `Custom`.

When no text has been added to the Published category (see [Text](texts.html)) the avatar will display as a square, and custom avatars should be prepared accordingly in a 1:1 ratio. If there is a Published Text, you can upload the cover into the `Custom` panel, and it will display according to the dimensions it was prepared.

All custom uploads should be no less than 400px along their shortest dimension.
