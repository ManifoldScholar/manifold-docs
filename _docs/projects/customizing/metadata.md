The `Metadata` panel on the project page provides a means to input metadata that is applicable to the project as whole. To adjust metadata specific to a text or resource, see the [Text](texts.html#managing-texts) and [Resource](resources.html) sections, respectively.

For a full description the fields available on this screen, see our [reference section](/docs/reference/metadata.html), which will also provide an overview of the metadata fields available to other aspects of a project.
