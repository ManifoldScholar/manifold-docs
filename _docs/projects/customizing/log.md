This menu provides a list of changes to a project's fields and resources, including the nature of the change, who made it (with a link to their User account), and the date on which the change was made.

If questions arise about how a project reached it's current state, especially for projects that are being managed by multiple users, this menu will be a useful in reviewing it's history and dialoging with those who played an active role in shaping it.
