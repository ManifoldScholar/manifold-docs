The Texts panel will be one that users will often interact with, as this is the spot where texts are added, categorized, updated, and set as the published version of record.

For new projects or projects that haven't yet ingested a text, the panel is composed of two buttons (`Add a new text` and `Create a new category`) and two category sections with `Published` and `Uncategorized` for headings, respectively.

![Texts Panel](/docs/assets/projects/texts-panel.png)

When texts are added to a project they will be oriented the `Uncategorized` section. New, custom, category sections can be added as required to suit the needs of a project.

This section is portioned along the following themes:

* [Adding Texts to Projects](#adding-texts)
* [Grouping Texts by Category](#grouping-texts)
* [Published Texts](#published-texts)
* [Managing a Text's Details](#managing-texts)

## Adding Texts to Projects

To begin the process of adding a text to a project, click on the `Add a new text` button. When you do the system will overlay your screen with a modal menu labelled `Text Format`, which serves as a prompt to you for which file type you are going to load into the system. Your options are

``` txt
EPUB V2 or V3
Markdown Document(s)
Google Doc
HTML Document
```

Before adding a text, please read through the [Preparing Texts](/docs/projects/preparing.html) section to ensure your materials are in the necessary state for ingestion.

### File Selection

Select the radio button for the file type you want to upload and then click `Continue`â€”or if you want to back away from an upload at this time, you can click the `Cancel` button.

#### EPUB V2 or V3
After you select the EPUB format, a new modal will show up giving you the option to upload your EPUB file from your machine. You can either drag and drop the file into the area with the cloud icon, or you can click `Upload a File`, which will open a file directory window, allowing you to navigate to the file's location on your machine. When you have done so the cloud icon will change to a document icon and the filename will appear beneath it.

Alternatively, if your EPUB is already being hosted remotely, you can designate the URL where Manifold can fetch it. For instance, the following is the URL to the Standard Ebooks Project's copy of Edwin A. Abbott's *Flatland*:

``` txt
https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edwin-a-abbott/flatland/dist/edwin-a-abbott_flatland.epub
```

Note that the link is not to the page where you can download the file, but instead a direct link to the file itself.

Once you have selected a file or designated a URL, the `Continue` button will change from gray to green. Click it and a new modal will appear to analyze your file.

If you click the button and nothing happens, double check to make sure you have selected a valid file or URL.

#### Markdown Document(s)

After you select the Markdown option, a new modal will open where you can either drag and drop your zipped Markdown collection into the area with the cloud icon, or you can click `Upload a File`, which will open a file directory window, allowing you to navigate to the file's location on your machine. When you have done so the cloud icon will change to a document icon and the filename will appear beneath it. Click the green `Continue` button in the lower right and proceed the file analysis step.

#### Google Doc

After you select Google Doc, a modal will appear prompting you to enter the URL of your document. Paste the shareable link (secured from URL bar of your browser or from the Share menu in Google) into the modal and click `Continue` and proceed to the file analysis step.

#### HTML Document

After you select the HTML option, a new modal will open where you can either drag and drop your zipped HTML collection into the area with the cloud icon, or you can click `Upload a File`, which will open a file directory window, allowing you to navigate to the file's location on your machine. When you have done so the cloud icon will change to a document icon and the filename will appear beneath it. Click the green `Continue` button in the lower right and proceed the file analysis step.

### File Analysis

The file analysis modal will review the file you've suggested for ingestion, with the following output:

``` txt
Current State: Sleeping
Strategy: None
Text ID: This ingestion will create a new text
Log: Connecting to Manifold websocket...
```

Click on the green `Analyze` button in the lower right to proceed. A process will run silently behind view, and the readout will change to the following:

``` txt
Current State: Analyzed
Strategy: {file type selected earlier}
Text ID: This ingestion will create a new text
Log: Connecting to Manifold websocket...
     Ingesting "{filename}"
     Ingestor::Strategy::{file type}::Strategy can ingest? true
     Using strategy Ingestor::Strategy::{file type}::Strategy
```

If you the second to last line finishes with `Strategy can ingest? true` you are ready to proceed. Click on the green `Ingest` button in the lower right.

If the `Ingest` button does not turn green, there is a problem, and you can use the text in `Log` field when [reporting the error](/docs/index.html).

### File Ingestion

On the same modal your file way analyzed, Manifold will now ingest it. The `Current State` field will read `Processing`, and the log will stream text describing what the system is doing. If everything goes correctly, when the process is finished the `Current State` should say `Finished`, a hexadecimal value should be listed under the `Text ID`, and the last line of the log should read `Ingestion Complete`.

If you get anything different from the log, [reach out for support](/docs/index.html).

Otherwise, you can click on the green `Complete` button, and you will now see the text you ingested in the `Uncategorized` section of the panel.

Congratulations! Your text is now in Manifold!

## Grouping Texts by Category

Categories are a means to group and label texts in the system. By default there are two fixed categories: `Published` and `Uncategorized`.

To move a text from one category to another, simply click on the up/down arrows to the right of the category name.

A text in the `Published` category receives distinct treatment considered in the following section, `Published Texts`.

### Uncategorized

`Uncategorized` serves as the staging ground for all texts that are initially ingested. This category does not have a limit on the number of texts it can hold, nor are texts in this collection overlaid with a title ribbon.

### Custom Categories

If your project requires grouping texts in distinct clusters, or if you simply wish to indicate what state the text being presented is in (e.g., First Draft, Peer-Reviewed, etc.) you can create a custom category that will support those ends.

To create a custom category click on the `Create a new category` button, and a modal will appear asking you to name it. Click `Create Category`, and the new section will appear in both the front- and backend interfaces:

![Backend Categories](/docs/assets/projects/backend-categories.png)

![Frontend Categories](/docs/assets/projects/frontend-categories.png)

By default new categories are empty. When you move a project into a custom category the reader will overlay the bottom of the text with a yellow ribbon the category name. Here we have *War of the Worlds*, which we can see from the shots above is in the `Markdown Sample` category and displays a ribbon to the same effect:

![Title Ribbon](/docs/assets/projects/title-ribbon.png)

You can rename a category by clicking on the `Edit` button to the right of it's name or delete the category entirely by clicking on the `X` to the right of the `Edit` button.

Texts that are in a custom category that is being deleted will return to `Uncategorized` after the deletion has been confirmed.

To change the order in which the custom categories appear, click on the up/down arrows to the right of the category name.

## Published Texts

Moving a text from `Uncategorized` or a custom category to `Published`, indicates the text in question represent the project's version or record: the definitive published text.

Because of its nature, this category can only accept one text at a time.

When you move a text into this section, the [cover image](/docs/projects/customizing/appearance.html) will automatically show on the banner image, along with a `Start Reading` reading button and, if the document contains internal structuring, a link to view the titles contents.

![Published Hero](/docs/assets/projects/published-hero.png)

If the title is for sale, then a link to the online shopping cart and the purchase price will also appear beneath the cover if set in the [Appearance section](/docs/projects/customizing/appearance.html).

<small>
**Note**. For [open-access or enhanced projects](/docs/publishing/project_types.html), there is no question which document is considered the version of record. But for iterative projects there may be more of a discussion. See the [Workflow section](/docs/publishing/workflow.html) for some thoughts that may better orient those internal discussions.
