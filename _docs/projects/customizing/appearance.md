The Appearance section of the project page controls the bulk of the display elements at the top of the frontend project landing page:

![Landing Appearance](/docs/assets/projects/landing-appearance.png)

## Description

This field holds a brief description of the project as a whole. Recommended length would range from three to five sentences. Text entered here can be formatted with [basic Markdown syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/).

## Hero Image

The hero image displays as a banner across the top of the project landing page and sits behind all the other elements described in this section.

Your image should be sized to 1280 Ã— 800 pixels. Images not submitted at those dimensions will be scaled by the system to best approximate them and cropped along the bottom edge accordingly to fit the space.

Acceptable formats for upload are GIF, JPG, JPEG, PNG, and SVG.

**Warning**. Be sure you have the necessary permissions to upload your hero image to the system.
