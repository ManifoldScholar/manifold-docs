Collections are groupings of resources that can be used to orient a reader around certain themes or as a means to place a series of resources onto a text with one insertion.

Collections appear and take display precedence in the Resources blade of a project's landing page, where their individual contents can be accessed and engaged with:

For details on how to place a Collection in a Text, see the [Reading Interface](/docs/reading/interface/placing.html) section.

## Creating a New Resource Collection

Resource Collections are created through the `Collections` sidebar of the backend project page:

![Collections Sidebar](/docs/assets/projects/collections.png)

### Required User Credentials

To access the Collections sidebar and create a new Collection, a user who has a `Reader` or `Project Creator` role will require `Can Modify Project` permissions for the project in question. Users with `Marketeer`, `Editor`, or `Administrator` roles will, by default, be able to create new Collections in the instance where they have those credentials.

For more information about credentials, see the [User Accounts](/docs/projects/accounts/index.html) section.

### Adding a Collection to a Project

To create a new Collection of resources, click the `Add a New Collection` button.

You will be prompted to enter a `Title`, `Description`, and upload a `Cover Image` for the new Collection. Only a `Title` is required at this point, and all three fields can be updated later.

The `Cover Image` should be prepared in a 9:4 ratio and saved as a GIF, JPEG, JPG, PNG, or SVG.

Once you hit `Save and Continue` your Collection will be created and you'll be taken to the Collection landing page, denoted by two sidebar items: `General` and `Resources`.

The `General` sidebar allows you to modify the `Title`, `Description`, and `Cover Image`. The `Resources` sidebar, discussed further in the following section, will be the means by which you add different resources to the collection.

## Adding Resources to a Collection

To add a Resource to a Collection, select the Collection you wish to edit from the list displayed from the `Collections` sidebar, and then select `Resources` from the new sidebar that appears.

Here you will be shown a list of all Resources associated with a project. If no Resources have been added, refer to the [Adding Resources](resources.html#adding-resources-single) section before proceeding.

Next to each available Resource there will be a slider. Toggling a Resource's slider to the right (so that green is showing on the slide) adds that Resource to the Collection.

To review all the Resources you've added to the Collection, click `Show Collection Only` next to the `Resources` heading above the search bar. This will allow you to remove items from the collection without having to parse through all the available Resources at once.

You can also use the search bar to set parameters—name, tag, kind—as a means to refine the list of available Resources down to a smaller set you may want to toggle in or out of the Collection.
