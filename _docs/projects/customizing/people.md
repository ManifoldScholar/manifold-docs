In this menu users who have permissions to modify the project at hand can associate Maker records with it. Doing so relates a Maker record to the project as a whole and not to a specific text within it. For more about the latter, please refer to the [Texts section](texts.html).

Maker records can be associated with a project as `Authors` or as `Contributors`. At present there are no options for more refined categorization (i.e., Edited by, Translated by, Introduction by, etc.)

When a Maker is associated with a project as an Author, their name and avatar (if one has been added to the record) will appear on the project landing page, beneath the project title, and also in the project library, beneath the project's cover or avatar.

Makers associated as Contributors will have their name show up only on the project landing page beneath the author's name. Their avatar will not be included.

<small>
**Note**. Associating a Maker record as an Author in this space is not the same as giving a user account “Is a Project Author” permissions. For more on the distinction, see the [Users section](\docs\projects\accounts\users.html).

## Associating Maker Records with Projects

To associate a Maker record with a project as either an `Author` or `Contributor`, click the `Add an Author` field beneath the appropriate heading and begin typing the name of the user you are looking for. The system will suggest names to you of records already in the system, based of what you have typed. Click on the result that matches the Maker you are searching for, and the record will be associated to the project as either an `Author` or `Contributor` and listed beneath the appropriate heading.

If there are no results for the name you type, you may need to [create a new Maker record](\docs\projects\accounts\creating.html).

## Editing or Removing Makers

From this screen you can modify the user accounts that are associated with the project or remove them from the project entirely by clicking on the pen or “X” icons, respectively. More details about this process can be found in the [creating Makers section](\docs\projects\accounts\creating.html), under the `New Project-Level Maker Records` heading.

## Changing Record Order

If there is more than one record under the `Author` or `Contributor` heading, you will have the option to manage in which order they will display, by clicking on the up or down arrow between the edit and remove icons to the right of the record's name:

![Order Maker](/docs/assets/projects/order-maker.png)

When you do so the listing will move up or down accordingly and display throughout the system in the order in which you see them here.
