When you click on an existing project from the project list, you will be taken to the project's Edit page, where you can modify, add, or remove texts, resources, and metadata associated with it, as well as adjust how the project appears for readers.

The Edit page is divided between a header, sidebar, and editing panel. The header displays the title and subtitle of the project you are currently editing with options to Preview or Delete it.

Clicking `Preview` will load the project's landing page in a new browser tab, allowing you to preview any changes you've made without having to exit the backend.

When you click the `Delete` button, the system will prompt you to confirm that you want to delete the project. If you click `Yes`, all of the project's texts, resources, annotations, highlights, and comments will be purged from the system; however, project authors will remain unless they are removed manually through the [People](/docs/projects/people/index.html) menu. There is no means to recover a project that has been deleted.

Editing options are grouped into the eight sidebar categories named below and are described in full in those sections:

* [General](customizing/general.html)
* [Appearance](customizing/appearance.html)
* [People](people/index.html)
* [Texts](texts/index.html)
* [Resources](resources/index.html)
* [Collections](resources/collections.html)
* [Activity](customizing/activity.html)
* [Metadata](customizing/metadata.html)
* [Social](customizing/social.html)

When you click on a sidebar item the editing panel will adjust to reveal editing options particular to that section. You must save any changes, using the `Save Project` button at the bottom of the editing panel, within one section before making adjustments in another. If you make changes without clicking `Save Project` the system will prompt you to do so before proceeding.
