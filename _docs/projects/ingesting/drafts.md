Drafts allow users to assemble and preview projects before publication. Drafts are not an authoring space, rather a place for users to adjust customization and metadata in advance of publication. Drafts are not visible to the public.

Drafts are available to users who have permissions that allow access (users who can edit the project, global admins, editors). While texts are drafts, users may annotate and highlight and even share as with a published text. Links shared on Twitter will only work for those who also have access to the text.

Determining when drafts are made public falls to the discretion of publishers. You can learn about published texts [in this section](published.html) or for an overview check the recommendations for [publishing workflow](workflow.html).
