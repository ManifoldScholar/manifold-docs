Project Collections are a way to customize and control the way projects are displayed on the Manifold homepage. Collections displace a publisher's library of projects on the landing page in favor of “blades” or “blocks” of projects curated manually or algorithmically around specific subjects and tags. Thus, instead of showcasing a library of projects, ordered only by title, it is possible to portion out the Manifold landing page by theme, around specific events or conferences, current events, or as a means to suggest titles to readers they may not have otherwise considered to be of interest.

Only those collections denoted as visible will appear on the Manifold landing page, but all collections, regardless of visibility status, will appear on an instance's Project Collection page, accessible by clicking `See Project Collections` at the bottom of the Projects page.

## Creating a Project Collection

To create new or modify existing project collections, a user will need to log into the Manifold backend with Administrator, Editor, or Marketeer credentials. From the backend dashboard, navigate to the `Projects` menu and then select `Project Collections` from the submenu:

### Project Collection Sidebar

The Project Collections page will display a list of existing collections on the left sidebar. The sidebar displays the collection's title, number of projects in the collection, a toggle to quickly change its homepage visibility status, and a handle to reorder the collections.
