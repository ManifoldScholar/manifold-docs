Makers represent people who author, edit, or otherwise produce the projects and texts on Manifold.

Only Maker accounts can be assigned as authors or contributors of projects and texts, though Makers can have different roles on different projects (e.g., an author of one project may be a contributor to another). To associate Makers with a specific project, refer to the [Projects](projects\people.md) section.

Maker accounts are created automatically by the system when a text is ingested, populated by author metadata included within those texts. If your text doesn't have the requisite metadata, Maker accounts can be created manually by Users with Administrative credentials. See the [Projects section](projects\people.md) for details on that process.

When linked to a User account with Author credentials, the system will know when a project author is highlighting, annotating, or commenting on his or her own workâ€”and they will carry a special designation distinguishing them from other reader interactions. An author's highlights will appear in `{color}`, and annotations and comments will appear with an author badge beside them.

## Account Management

This section describes how to modify Maker accounts and assumes you are in the Maker account drawer.

### Deleting a Maker

To delete a Maker account, click the `Delete Maker` button beside the red trashcan icon under the Maker's name.  You will receive a warning asking you to confirm you want to delete this particular Maker. Deleting a Maker permanently removes them from the system. Projects to which they are associated will otherwise be unaffected.

### Adjusting a Maker's Name

You can directly modify a Maker's name using the `First Name`, `Middle Name`, `Last Name`, and `Suffix` headers. Click `Save Maker` near the bottom of the drawer to push your changes into the system.

### Maker Avatars

You can add a Maker avatar in either JPEG, TIFF, GIF, or PNG format to the system under the `Avatar Image` heading. Images should be in a 1:1 ratio and no less than 40 pixels wide. Maker avatars display beneath the title on the project landing page.

### Linking to a User Account

At the bottom of the account drawer there will be a heading titled `Users`, with a button prompting you to `Add an associated user`. Click the add button and then choose an existing User account to associate with the present Maker account. The system will confirm the link has been established.
