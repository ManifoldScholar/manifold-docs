# People

The management of all user accounts is contained within the People menu. This section of documentation will describe each role, how they differ from one another, what system functionality is unlocked according to those credentials, and how to edit and modify user accounts. The following sections presume you are working in the People section of the backend:

*	[Users](users.md)
*	[Makers](makers.md)
