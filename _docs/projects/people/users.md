User accounts are for those who are logging into Manifold to engage with projects. Users are created by those first signing up for an account with a particular instance of Manifoldâ€”or by an existing user with Administrator credentials on behalf of one who doesn't yet have an account. User accounts carry different credentials according to the following roles:

## Roles

### Administrator

The Administrator role can access and use all of the backend's capabilities as well as annotate texts with resources.

### Reader

The Reader role is the default for all new users to the system. After creating an account, Readers can login and save their viewing preferences, highlights, annotations, and comments across Projects on that particular instance of Manifold.

### Author

Accounts with Author credentials maintain the same privileges as a Reader and extend them in the following ways: when linked with a Maker profile, Authors can annotate texts with resources that have already been loaded into the system, and an Author's highlights, annotations, and comments will carry a special designation differentiating them from other user's marks. Authors will also be able to access and interact with the [Author Dashboard](author-dashboard.md).

### Contributor

A contributor isn't a proper role in the system but a label. Contributor's are functionally the same as authors and simply describe project authors who aren't listed first on the byline.

## Account Creation

To create a new User account, click `Add a New User` from the User listings page. If there are no existing users in the system, this button will appear alone; otherwise it will always appear as the first entry. A drawer will open up from the right prompting for the users's email, role, and name. The system will automatically generate a password for the new user. To view or adjust it, click on the eye icon beside the password heading. When you click `Save User` the new account will be created, and the details, including password, will be automatically sent to the email entered for the account.

## Account Management

This section describes how to modify User accounts and assumes you are in the User account drawer, accessed by clicking on a name from the list of Users.

### Changing a User's Password

To change a User's password, click `Reset Password` below the user's name. A prompt will come up asking if you want to Generate a New Password or Set a New Password. If you click `Generate New Password` the system will automatically create a new password and email it to the address on file. If you click `Generate New Password` you can manually input a new password and save it to the system.

### Deleting a User

To delete a User account, click the `Delete User` button beside the red trashcan icon under the User's name.  You will receive a warning asking you to confirm you want to delete this particular Maker. Deleting a User permanently removes them from the system along with any highlights, annotations, or comments they have made.

### Adjusting a User's Email

Under the `EMAIL` heading in the drawer you can directly modify a User's email address. Click `Save Maker` near the bottom of the drawer to push your changes into the system.

### Adjusting a User's Name

You can directly modify a User's name using the `First Name`, `Middle Name`, `Last Name`, and `Suffix` headers. Click `Save Maker` near the bottom of the drawer to push your changes into the system.

### Linking to a Maker Account

At the bottom of the account drawer there will be a heading titled `Makers`, with a button prompting you to `Add or create a maker`. Click the add button and then choose an existing Maker account to associate with the present Maker account. If there is no account already present in the system that you want to link, you can manually key in a name, and the account will be created (and can then be modified in the Maker section). The system will confirm the link has been established.

### User Avatars

User avatars are not accessible from the User account drawer. User avatars can only be added or modified by users themselves from the Edit Profile link attached to their avatar dropdown menu.
