Only Maker accounts can be assigned as authors or contributors of projects and texts, though Makers can have different roles on different projects (e.g., an author of one project may be a contributor to another). To associate Makers with a specific project, refer to the [Projects](/docs/projects/customizing/people.html) section.

Maker accounts are created automatically by the system when a text is ingested, populated by author metadata included within those texts. If your text doesn't have the requisite metadata, Maker accounts can be created manually by users with Administrative, Editor, or Project Creator credentials. See the [Creating Accounts](creating.html) page for details on that process.
