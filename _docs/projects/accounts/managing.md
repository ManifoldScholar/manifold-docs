This section describes how to modify and manage Manifold accounts in the backend and assumes you are in the User (or Maker) account drawer, accessed by clicking on a name from the list of Users (or Makers) under the Records menu.

<div style="background: #d4f2ff; margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px;">
<strong>Note</strong>. Everything described here referring to User accounts requires Administrator credentials. To modify specific Maker accounts you need only have permission to modify a project with which that Maker record is associated.

## Modifying User Accounts

### Changing a User's Password

To change a User's password, click `Reset Password` below the user's name, beside the green key icon. A prompt will come up asking if you want to Generate a New Password or Set a New Password. If you click `Generate New Password` the system will automatically create a new password and email it to the address on file. If you click `Generate New Password` you can manually input a new password and save it to the system.

### Deleting a User

To delete a User account, click the `Delete User` button beside the red trashcan icon under the User's name.  You will receive a warning asking you to confirm you want to delete this particular Maker. Deleting a User permanently removes them from the system along with any highlights, annotations, or comments they have made.

### Adjusting a User's Email

Under the `EMAIL` heading in the drawer you can directly modify a User's email address. Click `Save Maker` near the bottom of the drawer to push your changes into the system.

### Adjusting a User's Name

You can directly modify a User's name using the `First Name`, `Middle Name`, `Last Name`, and `Suffix` headers. Click `Save Maker` near the bottom of the drawer to push your changes into the system.

### User Avatars

User avatars are not accessible from the User account drawer. User avatars can only be added or modified by users themselves from the `Edit Profile` link attached to their avatar dropdown menu.

## Modifying Maker Records

The Maker record drawer is also accessible from (1) the `People` sidebar link under the `Projects` menu and (2) the `People` sidebar of a specific text, arrived at by clicking the name of a text under `Texts` in the `Projects` menu and then `People` from the truncated sidebar.

### Deleting a Maker

To delete a Maker account, click the `Delete Maker` button beside the red trashcan icon under the Maker's name.  You will receive a warning asking you to confirm you want to delete this particular Maker. Deleting a Maker permanently removes them from the system. Projects to which they are associated will otherwise be unaffected.

### Adjusting a Maker's Name

You can directly modify a Maker's name using the `First Name`, `Middle Name`, `Last Name`, and `Suffix` headers. Click `Save Maker` near the bottom of the drawer to push your changes into the system.

### Maker Avatars

You can add a Maker avatar in either JPEG, TIFF, GIF, or PNG format to the system under the `Avatar Image` heading. Images should be in a 1:1 ratio and no less than 40 pixels wide. Maker avatars display beneath the title on the project landing page.
