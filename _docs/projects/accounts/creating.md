## Users vs. Makers

Users are those who sign up for a Manifold account as a means to actively engage with projects. That may be simply as a Reader, who can highlight and annotate text, share materials to social media, or take part in conversations with other readers. Or, depending on the role assigned to a user, they might also access the backend where they could change or add materials to a project or entire Manifold instance.

Maker records are just that—records appended to a project to describe those who have authored, edited, or otherwise produced the projects and texts on Manifold.

If we had _Jane Eyre_ loaded into the system we'd have a Maker record for Charlotte Brontë, but there couldn't be a Charlotte Brontë User account.

## Creating User Account

### From the Homepage
User accounts can be created by new visitors to a Manifold instance by clicking on the silhouette avatar in the upper left of the screen and then clicking `Need to sign up?` on the modal screen that pops up. From there

### From the Backend
To create a new User account in the backend, navigate to the People menu in the backend, select `Users` from the sidebar, and click `Add a New User` below the search bar:

![New User](/docs/assets/projects/new-user.png)

If there are no existing users in the system, this button will appear alone; otherwise it will always appear as the first entry. A drawer will open up from the right prompting for the users's email, role, and name.

**Caution**. Before creating a live account, please consult the [User Accounts](users.html) page to see which permissions are associated with each of the different roles available in the system.

The system will automatically generate a password for the new user. To view or adjust the password, click on the eye icon beside the password heading.

When you click `Save User` the new account will be created, and the details, including password, will be automatically sent to the email entered for the account.


## Creating a Maker Record

Maker accounts are created automatically by the system when a text is ingested, populated by author metadata included within those texts. If your text doesn't have the requisite metadata, Maker accounts can be created manually by users with Administrative, Editor, or Project Creator credentials in either the Projects of People menus.
