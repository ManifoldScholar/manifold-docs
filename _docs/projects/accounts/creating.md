## Creating a New User

To create a new User account, click `Add a New User` from the User listings page. If there are no existing users in the system, this button will appear alone; otherwise it will always appear as the first entry. A drawer will open up from the right prompting for the users's email, role, and name. The system will automatically generate a password for the new user. To view or adjust it, click on the eye icon beside the password heading. When you click `Save User` the new account will be created, and the details, including password, will be automatically sent to the email entered for the account.

Before creating a live account, please consult the [User Roles](users.html) page to see what permissions are associated with the different roles.

## Creating a New Maker

Maker accounts are created automatically by the system when a text is ingested, populated by author metadata included within those texts. If your text doesn't have the requisite metadata, Maker accounts can be created manually by users with Administrative, Editor, or Project Creator credentials.

<!-- ADD alternate means of adding from projects menu. -->
