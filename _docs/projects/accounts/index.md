This section of documentation will describe how to create and modify accounts, how the various accounts types and roles differ, and what system functionality is unlocked according to the various permission allowances. The management of all Manifold accounts is primarily contained within the backend's People menu; some functionality is also found in a projects sidebar and will be detailed in the [Customizing portion of this documentation](/docs/projects/customizing/index.html), specifically in the [Permissions](/docs/projects/customizing/permissions.html) and [People](/docs/projects/customizing/people.html) sections.
