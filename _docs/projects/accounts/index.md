This section of documentation describes how to create and modify user accounts and maker records (see below on how the two are different), how the various user roles differ, and what system functionality is unlocked through the different permission allowances that can be assigned to users.

## User Accounts vs. Maker Records

User accounts are for those who sign up for a Manifold account as a means to actively engage with a project's texts or resources. That may be simply as a Reader—who can highlight and annotate text, share materials to social media, or take part in conversations with other readers—or, depending on the [role](users.html) designated to them, it might also mean accessing the backend where the user could change or add materials to a project or entire Manifold instance.

Maker records are just that—metadata records appended to a project to describe those who have authored, edited, or otherwise produced the projects and texts on Manifold. More simply, Maker records are bylines with avatars.

An example of how these two differ: if _Jane Eyre_ was loaded into the system, there would be a maker record for Charlotte Brontë, but there couldn't be a Charlotte Brontë user account.

## See Also

While Manifold accounts are primarily managed within the backend's People menu; some functionality is also found in a projects sidebar and is detailed in the [Customizing Projects](/docs/projects/customizing/index.html) portion of this documentation, specifically the [Permissions](/docs/projects/customizing/permissions.html) and [People](/docs/projects/customizing/people.html) sections.

To learn how to associate a contemporary author's user account with their own project, see the the [People](/docs/projects/customizing/people.html).
