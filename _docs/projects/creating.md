To create a new project in the system, click the `Add a New Project` button on the backend Dashboard, or, alternatively, navigate to the Projects menu and under the All Projects submenu click the button of the same name.

Doing so will bring up a prompt for the new project's title, subtitle, and description. Only the title field is required, though any information entered now can be modified later.

When you click `Save and Continue`, your new project will be created, and the system will deliver you to the project page.

<strong>Note</strong>. To create a new project you must have an Administrator, Editor, or Project Creator role. For more information, see the <a href="accounts/users.html">User Accounts</a> section.

Before you begin, it will be handy to have the following at the ready: [a project description](/docs/projects/customizing/layout.html#description), a [hero image](/docs/projects/customizing/layout.html#backImage), and a [project thumbnail](/docs/projects/customizing/general.html#thumbnail).
