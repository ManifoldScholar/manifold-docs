To create a new project in the system, navigate to the [backend dashboard](index.html) click the `Add a New Project Button` at the head of the Project List. Doing so will bring up a prompt for the new project's title, subtitle, and description. Only the title field is required, though any information entered now can be modified later. When you click `Save and Continue`, your new project will be created, and the system will deliver you to the project's `Edit` page.

**Note**. To create a new project you must have an Administrator, Editor, or Project Creator role. For more information, see the [User Accounts](accounts/users.html) section.
