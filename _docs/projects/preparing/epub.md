Both EPUB2 and EPUB3 formats are viable on Manifold. For best results, make sure your EPUB file [validates](http://validator.idpf.org/) with no errors before loading it to the system.

If you are creating your EPUB file from a program like InDesign, avoid exporting it as a fixed-layout document (FXL): fixed-layout EPUBs are structured very specifically to mirror a printed work, and the format of the underlying coding will prevent your file from ingesting correctly on Manifold.

For more about the EPUB spec, please refer to the standard as defined on the [IDPF website](http://idpf.org/epub/31).
