Manifold can ingest any Google Doc that is publicly available or that has its permissions set so that anyone with the link can view it.

Structure, rendering (including indentation), tables, and figures that are part of the document will all transfer to Manifold in a way that is consistent with the source material, with the exceptions of columns, custom fonts, page breaks, and bullet points, which do not. Also of note, footnotes in a Google Doc come into Manifold as endnotes.

<div style="background: #d4f2ff; margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px;">
A Manifold instance must first be set up to <a href="/docs/customizing/settings/external_services/google/drive.html">integrate with Google Services</a> before it can ingest Google Docs.
