Resources are supplementary materials that support and contextualize a project's base text, extending the scope and focus of an author's work with formats not feasible in print. Resources can annotate specific passages of text; function as objects of inquiry, discussion, or exploration unto themselves; or be curated into collections with other resources as best suits the needs of the project.

There are ten resource types, described in detail here, that can be employed on the Manifold platform. Discussion of how to place resources onto texts is detailed in the [Reading Interface section](/docs/reading/interface/placing.html). For instructions on how to curate resources into collections, see the [Collections section](customizing/collections.html). And to learn how to add resources to a project, visit the [Customizing Projects section](customizing/resources.html).

File variants are available for all downloadable Resource types. In practice this means that high-res versions of artwork or different system files (e.g., Mac, PC, Linux) can be provided alongside the primary resource to meet reader needs.
