The Projects page is the default landing space when accessing the backend. Here new projects can be created and existing ones modified.

## Search

The search bar immediately below the Projects header allows a user to search through existing projects in the system and to then access those projects directly from the list of results that appears below the search bar. The search engine, powered by Elasticsearch, evaluates titles, subtitles, and author names, returning exact, as well as likely, matches.

To clear your current search, click on `Reset Search` beneath the search bar.

## Project List

The project list displays all projects (in groups of five) that have been created on an instance of Manifold. The project list is displaced by active search results from the search bar above the list. If no projects have yet been created, only the `Add a New Project` button will be present.
