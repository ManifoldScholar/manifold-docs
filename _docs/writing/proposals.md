Unless otherwise invited to do so by your publisher, plan on submitting a prospectus in advance of a complete manuscript. The submission of unrevised dissertations, unless solicited, is generally discouraged. Your prospectus should include, at a minimum, the following information:

*	An overview of your project, made up of
	*	a summary of its main contributions;
	*	a description of the theoretical framework and methodology that you employ (if applicable);
	*	a comparison of your work against others in the field and an explanation of how your research distinguishes itself from them;
	*	a description of the project’s target audience(s); and
	*	a sense of why your project is particularly suitable for Manifold, with details of those aspects of the platform you'd like to take advantage of
*	Draft table of contents and chapter summaries
*	Manuscript specifics, such as estimated
	*	word length (including notes and citations),
	*	completion date, and
	*	number and type of illustrations intended for the print edition
*	Platform specifics, including
	*	a sense of the kinds of media you have access to and would like serve your audience beyond those intended for any print edition;
	*	expected publishing schedule (e.g., weekly, monthly); and
	*	extending from that, a brief description of how (and how often) you expect to engage with the platform and your readers, both before and after the publication of the monograph
*	An outline of subvention sources, if any, that might be available to support the open-access edition
*	Current curriculum vitae for each of the project's contributors
*	Your contact information, including mailing address, phone numbers, and e-mail address
