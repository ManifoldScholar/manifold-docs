Resources are supplementary materials that support and contextualize a project's base text, extending the scope and focus of an author's work with formats not feasible in print. Resources can annotate specific passages of text; function as objects of inquiry, discussion, or exploration unto themselves; or be curated into collections with other resources as best suits the needs of the project.

There are ten resource types, described in detail here, that authors can employ on the Manifold platform. Discussion of how to place and curate resources into collections will be included in a forthcoming section of the documentation.

File variants are available for all downloadable Resource types. In practice this means that high-res versions of artwork or different system files (e.g., Mac, PC, Linux) can be provided alongside the primary resource to meet reader needs.
