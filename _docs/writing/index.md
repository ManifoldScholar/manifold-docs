Manifold projects begin with authors and their willingness to think beyond the normal confines of traditional print strictures. Allowing for a much more expansive archive of primary sources, such as field notes, moving images, audio, interactive data and maps, photographs, interviews, and archival material, a Manifold project asks that an author think creatively about the broad set of materials that is collected in the process of researching and writing a book. A Manifold project can be iterative, showing how a book evolves in real time, drawing on the collective expertise of early readers to crystallize its core arguments. Early drafts of chapters, journal articles, and field notes can show, long before the finished book is published, the authorâ€™s arguments evolving and resonating with a community of readers.

This section of documentation is intended to be used by Manifold authors who are looking to better understand how the platform can serve and showcase [their materials](resources.md), what kinds of [rights concerns](rights.md) they are likely going to need to negotiate for their publisher, how to [approach a publisher](project_proposals.md) with a Manifold edition in mind, and best practices for [authoring](writing.md) their material for this and all modern publishing systems.
