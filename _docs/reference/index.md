The Manifold Documentation Reference section provides:

* information about the history of [downloads](downloads.html)
* key metadata terms and abbreviations (coming soon), and
* a [glossary](glossary.html) of Manifold-specific vocabulary.

As the documentation evolves, we expect these sections to expand. We encourage the community to request revisions and to contribute to our documentation. Please open an issue or submit a pull request at [our documentation repository](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold-docs-jekyll).
