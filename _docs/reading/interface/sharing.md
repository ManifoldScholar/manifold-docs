Selecting `Share` allows you to post selected text to your configured Twitter account. Selecting Twitter opens another tab in your browser window directed to Twitter. If you are already logged in to Twitter, it will automatically populate your tweet with an image and links back to the point you highlighted in the text. Otherwise Manifold will fill the tweet template and offer an option to sign in or sign up on Twitter.

`Cite` will allow you to copy and cite the text formatted according to either Chicago, MLA, or APA style. If certain metadata is missing from a Text, the Cite option will not appear.
