## Getting Started
What does documentation for the Manifold reader look like? When you open up a book on Manifold, you have many options for the look of your reading interface. This documentation is here to help. How do I change the font? Where do my notes go? How do I skip to the next chapter? Manifold strives to make your digital reading experience straightforward and to aid your digital note-taking and citation. As a reader, you will have your own sense of how a digital text works and how it fits into your regular work flow. These features do some of the work for you without imposing on your personal preferences.

## The Reading Interface
Once you login, you have the opportunity to read with features dedicated to your own work. Clicking into a project lands you at the first pages of the text. You may click through from start to finish, or navigate to the contents to jump directly to the chapter most pertinent to your needs.

You may change the look of the interface itself. At the top right of the menu, in addition to your personal account icon, you will see an eye and "Aa" icons. The eye icon (<o>) lets you reveal or hide your comments/highlights/annotations. The "Aa" takes you to a menu of formatting options to customize your reading. You may enlarge the text, choose serif or sans serif font, invert the color (black on white or white on black text), and increase or decrease the margins.

From the Project page, you can "Start Reading," which will open from the title page, or you can go to "Contents," to see linked chapter titles and section headings. You can turn pages by clicking "Previous" or "Next" buttons at the bottom of each page or by selecting the linked heading under "Next."

You may also return to Project Home, Projects overview, or Following by the top left "Menu" tab. The top "Contents" tab will open the table of contents in a slide navigation bar on the left. Clicking again will close the contents menu. This means you can look at the contents without losing your place on the page.

Endnotes within the text are linked so that you may go from text to notes and back without scrolling.

When logged into Manifold, you have a number of note-taking options within a text. When you use your cursor to select the text you wish you to engage with, a menu will appear asking if you wish to [Share](#share), [Annotate](#annotate), or [Highlight](#highlight) the selected passage:

<a name="share"></a>
### Share
Selecting Share opens two further options: Cite and Twitter. The Cite option will allow you to copy and cite the text formatted according to either Chicago, MLA, or APA style. If certain metadata is missing from a Text, the Cite option will not appear.

Selecting Twitter opens another tab in your browser window directed to Twitter. If you are already logged in to Twitter, it will automatically populate your tweet with an image and links back to the point you highlighted in the text. Otherwise Manifold will fill the tweet template and offer an option to sign in or sign up on Twitter.

### Annotate
With Annotate, you can write notes which Manifold will save for you. You may choose to make your annotations private by selecting the tick box below the field where you type in your notes. If you leave your annotation publicly it can be commented on by other readers who are logged in.

Once you have clicked "Save," your notes will be attached to that project. When you return to the Project home page, you will find a counter indicating both how many highlights and how many annotations you have added to the project.

Commenting is a related but distinct functionality from annotations that describes interaction between readers. Unlike annotations, comments are strictly public and refer to responses to public annotations. Each comment is saved to the project and is associated with the account that created it. Comments can themselves be replied to and are set off visually from those they are responding up through four levels of nesting. After the fourth level, responses to comments aren't visually distinct, but replies are always possible, regardless of how deep a conversation may go. Additionally, comments can be edited by those who created them, deleted, or flagged as inappropriate.

Comments can also be applied to project resources. See the [resource section](../resources.md) for more information.

### Highlight
Highlighting provides you a means to set off specific passages of text visually.

Highlight lets you highlight text. All highlights are public, though yours are distinguished from those of other users by color: yours are blue, everyone else's are green. You may read with your highlights turned on or off, by clicking the eye icon in the top right menu. A green eye icon shows both annotations and highlights from all users, a gray icon shows none—not even your own—and a blue icon shows only the highlights and annotations you have personally supplied.
