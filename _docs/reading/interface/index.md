Once you login, you have the opportunity to read with features dedicated to your own work. Clicking into a project lands you at the first pages of the text. You may click through from start to finish, or navigate to the contents to jump directly to the chapter most pertinent to your needs.

You may change the look of the interface itself. At the top right of the menu, in addition to your personal account icon, you will see an eye and "Aa" icons. The eye icon (<o>) lets you reveal or hide your comments/highlights/annotations. The "Aa" takes you to a menu of formatting options to customize your reading. You may enlarge the text, choose serif or sans serif font, invert the color (black on white or white on black text), and increase or decrease the margins.

From the Project page, you can "Start Reading," which will open from the title page, or you can go to "Contents," to see linked chapter titles and section headings. You can turn pages by clicking "Previous" or "Next" buttons at the bottom of each page or by selecting the linked heading under "Next."

You may also return to Project Home, Projects overview, or Following by the top left "Menu" tab. The top "Contents" tab will open the table of contents in a slide navigation bar on the left. Clicking again will close the contents menu. This means you can look at the contents without losing your place on the page.

Endnotes within the text are linked so that you may go from text to notes and back without scrolling.

When logged into Manifold, you have a number of note-taking options within a text. When you use your cursor to select the text you wish you to engage with, a menu will appear asking if you wish to [Share](sharing.html), [Annotate](annotating.html), or [Highlight](highlighting.html) the selected passage.
