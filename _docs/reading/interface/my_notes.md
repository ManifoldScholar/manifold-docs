For each note, you will see a preview of the selected text on which you have taken the note. Clicking on the item takes you to the place in the text, to the comment. 

After clicking the notepad icon,  `SEE ALL` will bring you to a new display of only your notes in the order they appear in the text. These notes will include details of annotations as well as comments.
