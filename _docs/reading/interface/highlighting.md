Highlighting provides you a means to set off specific passages of text visually.

Highlighting lets you highlight text using your cursor as you read. All highlights are public, though yours are distinguished from those of other users by color: yours are blue, everyone else's are green. You may read with your highlights turned on or off, by clicking the eye icon in the top right menu. When you click the eye icon, you will see menu options to check on or off annotations and highlights from all users. You may read with any combination of the highlights and annotations you have personally supplied and those of others, or nothing at all.

Your highlights will be tallied and summarized in [My Notes](my_notes.html).
