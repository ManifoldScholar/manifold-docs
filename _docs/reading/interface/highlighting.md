Highlighting provides you a means to set off specific passages of text visually.

Highlight lets you highlight text. All highlights are public, though yours are distinguished from those of other users by color: yours are blue, everyone else's are green. You may read with your highlights turned on or off, by clicking the eye icon in the top right menu. A green eye icon shows both annotations and highlights from all users, a gray icon shows none—not even your own—and a blue icon shows only the highlights and annotations you have personally supplied.
