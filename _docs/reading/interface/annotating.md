With Annotate, you can write notes which Manifold will save for you. You may choose to make your annotations private by selecting the tick box below the field where you type in your notes. If you leave your annotation publicly it can be commented on by other readers who are logged in.

Once you have clicked `Save`, your notes will be attached to that project. When you return to the Project home page, you will find a counter indicating both how many highlights and how many annotations you have added to the project.

Commenting is a related but distinct functionality from annotations that describes interaction between readers. Unlike annotations, comments are strictly public and refer to responses to public annotations. Each comment is saved to the project and is associated with the account that created it. Comments can themselves be replied to and are set off visually from those they are responding up through four levels of nesting. After the fourth level, responses to comments aren't visually distinct, but replies are always possible, regardless of how deep a conversation may go. Additionally, comments can be edited by those who created them, deleted, or flagged as inappropriate.

Comments can also be applied to project resources. See the [resource section](/docs/reading/resources.html) for more information.
