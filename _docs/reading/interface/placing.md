The third option available when you highlight text in the reading interface is `RESOURCES`. This function allows you to connect resources in the project to specific passages within the text.

If you're logged in as an admin (or other credentials noted) you can highlight text in the reader and the `RESOURCE` option will open a drawer from the right allowing you to select a resource that's already been uploaded to that project.

Read more about Manifold Resources [here](/docs/reading/resources.html), or about uploading Resources [here](/docs/projects/resources.html).
