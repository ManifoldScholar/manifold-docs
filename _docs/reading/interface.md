Once you login, you have the opportunity to read project texts with features dedicated to your own work. When you click into a text, you can read through from start to finish or navigate through a contents dropdown on the top left, if the text is so structured, to jump directly to the section most pertinent to your needs. Clicking again will close the contents menu. This means you can look at the contents without losing your place on the page.

You may also return to the project homepage, the full library of projects, or those you are following through the top left `Menu` tab.

You can also navigate and adjust the look of the reading interface itself. Beside your personal account icon in the top right of the menu, you will see four icons: a notepad, an eye denoting visibility, `Aa` for appearance, and a spyglass for search:

<a name="notepad"></a>
## Notepad

The notepad displays a list of all the highlights and annotations you've made to a text in one place, allowing you to select them and be taken directly to the section of text in question. You have the option to view only annotations or highlights by checking the appropriate box.

If you click `SEE ALL` a new modal display will overlay your screen showing the entirety of your annotations and highlights, instead of the brief snippets provided in the dropdown.

<a name="visibility"></a>
## Visibility Menu

The eye icon opens the visibility menu and allows you to selectively reveal or hide highlights, annotations, or resources.

<a name="appearance"></a>
## Appearance

The `Aa` takes you to a menu of formatting options to adjust how the text shows in the reader. You may enlarge the text, choose serif or sans serif font, invert the color (black on white or white on black text), and increase or decrease the margins.

<a name="search"></a>
## Search

The spyglass opens a serach bar that allows you to search within the chapter, text, or project for words or passages of interest.

## Text Menus
When logged into Manifold, you have a number of note-taking options within a text, each of which are considered in their own respective sections, as follows: When you use your cursor to select the text you wish you to engage with, a menu will appear asking if you wish to [Share](sharing.html), associate a [Resource](placing.html) with, [Annotate](annotating.html), or [Highlight](highlighting.html) the selected passage.
