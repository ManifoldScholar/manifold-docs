The Manifold homepage acts as the library of titles a publisher is offering on the platform. This library is divided into three main categories: [Featured Projects](#featuredprojects), [Our Projects](#ourprojects), and [Following](#following).

Projects appear in the library with their thumbnail or cover image, title, author, and date of most recent update.

## Featured Projects

The first category of projects you will see on a Manifold landing page are the Featured Projects, titles suggested by the publisher to give you a curated sample of what's new and available.

<div style="background: #d4f2ff; margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px;">
If you are a backend user, projects can be added or removed individually from the Featured section through the <a href="/docs/projects/customizing/general.html">General sidebar</a>.

## Our Projects

Below Featured Projects is the Our Projects section, which displays all the publisher's holdings. From a dropdown menu, you can select filters to view titles by subject category assigned by the publisher.

Sorting projects by these categories creates a stable URL that can be shared so others can land on the page with the same results.

## Following

Following projects allows you to group those titles of interest to you in one place for easy access. To start following a project, click the green circle with a white plus sign on the top left of a project's thumbnail. When you hover over the plus sign you are given the option to follow that project. When you do so the green circle will change to a blue one with a white check mark. Likewise, you unfollow a project by hovering over the blue circle and selecting "unfollow."

Followed projects can be accessed by selecting Following from the top menu bar, or by clicking the `Projects You're Following` button below Featured Projects and Our Projects.
