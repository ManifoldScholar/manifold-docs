When you highlight a passage of text in the Manifold reader and select `Share` from the menu that appears, you have options for Cite, Twitter, and Facebook.

<a name="cite"></a>
## Cite

When you select Cite, Manifold prepares a reference for the text you are viewing in accordance with APA, MLA, or Chicago styles that you can use in your own writing. Click the `Copy` button to save the citation to your device's memory so you can paste it into whichever app you are using for the purpose. If certain metadata is missing from a Text, the Cite option will not appear.

For the Cite option to appear, the publisher must include in the text's metadata the title, author, publisher, and publication date. If any one of those fields is left blank, readers will not see “Cite” as an option when trying to share a text. It is also important to note that the more metadata the publisher provides, the better the citation will be. Backend users, to see which metadata fields are available for texts, see the <a href="/docs/reference/metadata.html">Reference section</a>, and to enter/adjust metadata for a text, see <a href="/docs/projects/customizing/texts.html#managing-texts">Managing Texts</a>.

<a name="twitter"></a>
## Twitter

Selecting Twitter opens a pop-up window where you can compose a new Tweet. If you are already logged in to Twitter, it will automatically populate your tweet with a snippet of the text you selected and link back to the highlighted spot in the text. Otherwise Manifold will fill the tweet template and offer an option to sign in or sign up on Twitter.

Included with your Tweet will be a card with a description of the project with a thumbnail based off the project's hero image.

<div style="background: #d4f2ff; margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px;">
For the Twitter option to appear, the publisher needs to configure their instance to integrate with Twitter, as described in the <a href="/docs/customizing/external_services/oauth/twitter.html">External Services</a> section.
</div>

<a name="facebook"></a>
## Facebook

Selecting Facebook opens a pop-up window where you can compose a new Facebook post. If you are already logged in to your Facebook account, it will automatically populate your post with a card describing the project alongside a thumbnail based off the project's hero image.

<div style="background: #d4f2ff; margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px;">
For the Facebook option to appear, the publisher needs to configure their instance to integrate with Facebook, as described in the <a href="/docs/customizing/external_services/oauth/facebook.html">External Services</a> section.
