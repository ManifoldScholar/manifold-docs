Projects in Manifold operate as containers the way books do on a shelf—only in Manifold, they contain not only the main text but also, potentially, draft and ancillary texts, supplemental media resources, as well as reader engagements with those materials.

Each project has its own landing page, made up of the following content blocks. Some projects may only have one block, others may use a good deal more.

<div style="background: #d4f2ff; margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px;">
If you are a backend user, instructions on how to manage content blocks are detailed primarily in the <a href="/docs/projects/customizing/layout.html">Layout</a> section, though the <a href="/docs/projects/customizing/general.html">General</a> section will also be of use.

## Hero Block

The hero block is meant to orient the reader to what the project is about and how to engage with it. Beyond providing a space for display elements such as the project's title, description, and attributions, it can also be used to connect to related engagements in the social media sphere, suggest points of entry to specific elements of the project, as well as provide related downloadable materials.   

## Markdown Block

The Markdown Block allows editors to create sections of markdown content on a project page. Possible uses of this block include adding additional descriptive text about the project or supplemental textual or audio/visual content that speaks its origins, how to engage or navigate it, how it may be related to current events or annual meetings, or if it is associated with any specific grants or funding sources.

## Metadata

The Metadata Block will render metadata about the project in three columns. The metadata in this block speaks to the project as a whole, instead of metadata specific to certain texts or resources, which appears adjacent to those materials.

<div style="background: #d4f2ff; margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px;">
The <a href="/docs/reference/metadata.html">Reference section</a> serves as a good introductory primer to the individual metadata fields available on the platform.

## Recent Activity

The Recent Activity block displays on tiles the last six activity records for the project. Activity records announce when new texts and resources are added to the project as well as the contents of Tweets that match search criteria, if so configured by an editor. If a project contains more than six activity records, users will be shown a button that links to the full, paginated list of activity on a separate screen. This block allows users to track the history of the project onsite as well as its engagements in the Twitterverse.

## Resources

The Resources Block renders a teaser of the ten most recently updated resources on a project, accompanied by a link to the resource library for that project as well as the total number of resources on the project. This block can also list each of the project’s resource collections.

<div style="background: #d4f2ff; margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px;">
For backend users interested in learning how to prepare resources for Manifold, the <a href="/docs/projects/resources.html">Preparing Resources</a> section will be useful.
</div>

## Table of Contents Block

The Table of Contents Block renders the table of contents for a specific text in the project. This block is especially useful for projects that only have one text, in which cases it’s generally more useful to render a TOC than to render a list of project texts.

## Text

The Text Block lists some or all texts associated with the project. The texts that are included in the list can be filtered to only include texts from one or more categories. The block can be configured to include or exclude author names, subtitles, dates, descriptions, and cover images in the output. The list can also be configured to group texts by category.

<div style="background: #d4f2ff; margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px;">
Discussion on how backend users can add and curate texts is considered in the <a href="/docs/projects/customizing/texts.html">Texts</a> section.
