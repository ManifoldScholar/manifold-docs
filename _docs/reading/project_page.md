## Overview

When you log into your Manifold account, you will see two main display options in the top left menu: Projects and Following. Projects in Manifold operate as containers the way books do on a shelf -- only in Manifold, they contain not only the main text but also supplemental resources beyond the scope of print appendices. The Project Page acts as a bookshelf view of the contents of your Manifold library. These items may be viewed on Projects which offers a selection of Featured Projects at the top of the page. Scrolling below Featured Projects, you will find a catalog of Our Projects, which displays the full library available on Manifold through the Press.

## Projects

Each project has its own home page. At the top of the page, you will find author photos, a book abstract, a `Start Reading` button, a `View Contents` button, Twitter and Facebook widgets, as well as the project hashtag, and a link to purchase the print version. This page displays the cover of the book, which you will also see on the [Projects Library](library/index.html) page.

Further down the Project home page, you will see a feed of `Recent Activity`. Because Manifold is iterative, and authors may add resources and texts, the feed provides information about when things are added.

Below this feed, you will find a segment titled "Texts" which shows you the version of the text you are reading, what date it was added, and tallies of how many notes and highlights you have added to the text.

Scrolling below "Texts," you will find "Resources," which shows [resources](resources.html) by collection. You will see a summary of the project's resources and you may follow a link to `View All Resources`.

Metadata comes after Resources. Before the footer, there is a link which will take you back to the Projects page.

## Following

The Following page allows you to keep track of those books you choose from the Press's catalog. You may add and remove projects as you wish.

For your easy organization, projects appear in your library with their cover image, title, author, and date of most recent update.

## Adding Projects

By clicking the "+" icon, you may add titles to your personal project library. If you select the "Following" option from the top menu, your projects will be displayed. If you hover your cursor over the select check mark, you will see you have the option to unfollow projects -- you will be asked to confirm before the action happens.

On the main project menu, you will also notice that books you already follow have a different mark than those which you have added.
