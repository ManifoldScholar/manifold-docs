## Annotating

If you're logged into Manifold, when you highlight text with your cursor a menu will appear providing you various options to interact with the text. If you select Annotate, a sliding drawer will open from the right where you can compose notes associated with the passage in question. Annotations can be made for public consideration or kept private by checking `This Annotation is Private`. If you leave your annotation publicly, it can be commented on by other readers who are logged in.

Once you have clicked `Save`, your annotation will be attached to that project. When you return to the Project homepage, you will find a counter indicating how many annotations (and highlights) you have added to the project.

## Commenting

Commenting is a related but distinct functionality from Annotating. Unlike annotations, comments are refer to responses to public annotations. Each comment is saved to the project and is associated with the account that created it. Comments can themselves be replied to and are set off visually from those they are responding up through four levels of nesting. After the fourth level, responses to comments aren't visually distinct, but replies are always possible, regardless of how deep a conversation may go.

Comments can also be applied to project resources. See the [resource section](/docs/reading/placing.html) for more information.

## Reading Groups

Reading groups allow readers to annotate texts as a cohort. This features is geared toward classroom and peer-review use cases. With reading groups, readers can create public, private, and anonymous annotation groups; invite others to their groups; and manage group membership. When engaging with a text, readers can associate their annotations with those groups of which they are a member.

### Accessing Reading Groups

To access reading groups, click the user profile icon in the upper right and select “Manage Groups” from the dropdown.

![Manage Groups](/docs/assets/reading/manage-groups.png)

On this Manage Reading Groups page you can create new reading groups, join a group, and see a listing of those groups you moderate or are a member.

![Group view](/docs/assets/reading/group-view.png)

Each group in the list includes a tag beside its name indicating whether the group is Public, Private, or Anonymous. The listing also indicates your relationship to the group—Moderator or Member—the number of members in the group, and a summary of the number of annotations and highlights the group has made. 

Clicking on a group entry in this listing will direct you to a specific group page, where you can see and sort through various engagements the group members have made across texts.

### Creating a Reading Group

To create a new reading group, navigate to the Manage Reader Groups page and click the `Create New Reading Group` button.

A drawer will open from the right with fields prompting you define the dynamics of the group:

#### Group Name

A group name is required to create a new reading group; however, the name can be modified at any time.

#### Privacy

Groups have three privacy options—public, private, and anonymous—that function along the following lines: 

- **Public**. Annotations and highlights made in public groups are viewable to everyone—even to readers who have not signed up for an account on the Manifold instance in question—but only group members are able to leave annotations and highlights under the auspices of the group.

Annotations made in public groups can be used by instructors to guide classroom conversation across sections or as a means to cultivate a scholarly edition of specific texts.
- **Private**. 
- **Anonymous**.
