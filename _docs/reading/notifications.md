Using the Notifications settings, Manifold readers can have the system send either a daily or weekly email that summarizes any new texts, resources, or resource collections that have been added to projects they are following. Daily notifications will be dispatched every day at 6:00 a.m. and weekly notifications every Sunday at 6:00 a.m (per the time the server is set to).

Additionally, readers can opt to have Manifold send an email in real time when a reply has been made to one of their annotations or comments.

Notification settings can be accessed and adjusted from the user dropdown in the upper righthand corner of the screen—or by clicking on the Notification Settings button at the bottom of the Edit Profile screen.

Readers, Project Creators, or Marketeers who have permissions to modify specific projects in the backend can opt to receive notification in realtime of *all* comments and annotations made to those projects by selecting Yes to “Notify You of All Comments and Annotations.” Likewise, users who have either Editor or Administrator roles who select that option will be notified of *all* comments and annotations in realtime for *all* projects on the instance.

Administrators, alone, also have the option to be notified of flagged comments in realtime.
