Manifold expands scholarly works in many ways. Importantly, Manifold makes available and portable a collection of relevant resources that support an author's textual materials. Research and data collected by the author (in a host of different file formats) can be served alongside the text to augment and enhance the richness of an author's argument.

## Placing Resources in Texts

If you're logged in with an account that has backend access and permissions to adjust the project in question, when you highlight a passage of text in the reader, the second option available in the menu that appears is Resource. This function allows you to associate any resource (or resource collection) that have already been loaded into the project's resource library with specific passages of text. This does not embed the resource into the text so much as lay them upon it.

 When you click `Resource`, a drawer will open from the right allowing you to select from any resource file that's already been uploaded to that project. When you select your resource (or collection) a gray cube will be placed at the end of your cursor selection and a thumbnail of the resource will appear in the left margin. When you hover over either they will turn a shade of green, and when clicked a modal will overlay the text previewing the resource or allowing you to interact with it, if it's of a kind playable in the browser.

## Resource Comments

Resources, like text, are also available for discussion on the platform. Each Resource in the system has its own landing page whereon you can comment and discuss the Resource publicly (comments to Resources cannot be made private). To access a resources landing page, click `Visit Resource Page` when previewing it in the text or by selecting it from the `All Project Resources` page available from the Resource blade on the project homepage.
