Manifold was created to fulfill specific functions for academic readers. This section of the documentation explains the [reading interface](interface.html) options and available activities like [annotation](annotating.html), [sharing passages](sharing.html) through social media, and creating [citations](sharing.html#cite) to properly reference Manifold materials in your own work. The placing of [resources](placing.html) and ways readers can organize their Manifold [project libraries](library.html) are also considered here and are oriented thusly:

- [Project Library](library.html)
- [Exploring Projects](projects.html)
- [Reading Interface](interface.html)
- [Sharing](sharing.html)
- [Exploring and Placing Resources](placing.html)
- [Annotating and Commenting](annotating.html)
- [Highlighting](highlighting.html)
- [Email Notifications](notifications.html)



To begin taking advantage of all the tools described in this section you must first create an account and sign in from the homepage.
