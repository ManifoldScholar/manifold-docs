Manifold expands scholarly books in many ways. Importantly, Manifold makes available and portable a collection of relevant resources that support the primary manuscript. Research and data collected by the author may be published alongside the text in different file formats.

You access Resources from each project home page or from any text annotated with themâ€”denoted in the reader by a gray cube that turns green when the cursor hovers over it. When accessed directly from the text, resources open a modal window allowing readers to review the resource and, depending on the resource type, engage with it directly without leaving the text.

Resources, like text, are also available for discussion on the platform. Each Resource in the system has its own page whereon you can comment and discuss the Resource publicly (comments to Resources cannot be made private). These comments will remain within your account when you return to the text and reopen the Resource. Each comment has options to "Reply," "Edit," "Delete," or "Flag."

Resources may also be shared by clicking the Twitter widget on the right of the Resource page, which will link back to the Manifold project.

If available for redistribution, resources may be downloaded by clicking the download button in the right hand column, just below the image and above the metadata.
