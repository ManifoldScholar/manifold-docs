If you're logged into Manifold, when you highlight text in the reader you will have the option to highlight the passage in question. Highlighting provides a means for you to set off specific passages of text visually for you and other readers.

All highlights are public, though yours are distinguished from those of other users by color: yours are blue, everyone else's are green. The exception would be for user's who have authorial credentials on a project; they're highlights will appear in red. You may read with your highlights turned on or off, by clicking the visibility (eye) icon in the top right menu.

Your highlights will be tallied and summarized in the [Notepad menu](/docs/reading/interface.html#notepad).
