The package installer creates a file at `/etc/manifold/manifold.rb`. Use this file to configure and manage the various services that Manifold is composed of. After changing this file, you'll need to run `sudo manifold-ctl reconfigure` from the command line so that Manifold picks up the changes and regenerates various configuration files based on the new settings.

For now, let's just make sure Manifold is on the right domain. Open `/etc/manifold/manifold.rb` in your preferred text editor (nano, vi, etc.) and look for the `external_url` setting near the top of the file. Set this to the fully qualified domain name of your Manifold installation, then reconfigure Manifold with the following command. You may be prompted to accept the license. You can scroll through the licenses by pressing space, or "q" to exit the license view. You will need to accept the licenses before proceeding with the installation.
